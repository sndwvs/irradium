NOTES

For optical audio/dvd/blu-ray playback you need to install
"libcdio-paranoia libdvdnav libbluray", respectively.

To take advantage of shell completions, install either zsh or 
bash-completion before building mpv.

The choice of video backend is left up to the user, in order for 
this port to satisfy a variety of use-cases (e.g., Wayland-only,
X11 with SDL, X11 without SDL). Before building this port, make
sure to install the desired optional dependencies for your
use-case (e.g., libvdpau, xorg-libxpresent, libsdl2). If you build 
mpv with *only* its hard dependencies present, you should expect a 
crippled package.
